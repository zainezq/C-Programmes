## Project Descriptions

### Project 1: Simple Sum Calculator
- **Description**: This C program calculates the sum of two numbers. It's a basic utility designed to add any two numbers entered by the user and display the result.

### Project 2: Factorial Calculator
- **Description**: The Factorial Calculator is a C program that computes the factorial of a given number. Factorial is the product of all positive integers from 1 to the given number. This program allows users to find the factorial of a number they specify.

### Project 3: Word Occurrence Counter
- **Description**: The Word Occurrence Counter is a C program that analyzes a text file and counts the occurrences of a specific word or phrase. It's a helpful tool for text analysis and can be used for various applications such as data processing and text mining.

### Project 4: Basic Calculator
- **Description**: This Basic Calculator C program is a versatile utility that performs four fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers. Users can input two numbers and choose the operation they want to perform, and the program returns the result.


## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to get a copy of the projects up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
#### Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:
#### - C Compiler: You need a C compiler like GCC to build and run the C programs.

### Installation
#### 1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

#### 2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd your-repo

#### 3. Compile the C program. If the project requires compilation, use the appropriate compiler. For example, to compile a C file named `program.c`:
gcc -o program program.c

#### 4. Run the program:
./program
Replace **program** with the respective exe file name that you have given in step 3
