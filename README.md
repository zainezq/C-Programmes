## Project Descriptions

### Project 1: Simple Sum Calculator (sum.c)
- **Description**: This C program calculates the sum of two numbers. It's a basic utility designed to add any two numbers entered by the user and display the result.

### Project 2: Factorial Calculator (factorial.c)
- **Description**: The Factorial Calculator is a C program that computes the factorial of a given number. Factorial is the product of all positive integers from 1 to the given number. This program allows users to find the factorial of a number they specify.

### Project 3: Word Occurrence Counter (occurence.c)
- **Description**: The Word Occurrence Counter is a C program that analyses a text file and counts the occurrences of a specific word or phrase. It's a helpful tool for text analysis and can be used for various applications such as data processing and text mining.

### Project 4: Basic Calculator (calculator.c)
- **Description**: This Basic Calculator C program is a versatile utility that performs four fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers. Users can input two numbers and choose the operation they want to perform, and the program returns the result.

### Project 5: Meet And Greet (meetAndGreet.c)
- **Description**: A simple C program that asks the user for their name and then greets them. 

### Project 6: Guess the number (guess.c)
- **Description**: A simple C program that asks the user for a number between 0-19 and then checks if it matches the random number generated.

### Project 7: Single Threaded client-server chat (single-threaded-chat/)
- **Description**: A basic client and server programs that allow a single client to send a message to the server, and the server echo's the message back to the client.
  
### Project 8: Simple Lexers for Learning Purposes

- **Description**: This repository contains two example lexers written in C that are intended for learning purposes. The lexers are not complete and do not handle all possible cases. They serve as a starting point for understanding the basics of lexer implementation in the context of compiler construction.

  
## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to get a copy of the projects up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

**Prerequisites**:

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- C Compiler: You need a C compiler like GCC to build and run the C programs.

**Installation**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/zainezq/C-Programmes.git
  ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
  
  ```bash
  cd C-Programmes/
  ```

4. Compile the C program. If the project requires compilation, use the appropriate compiler. For example, to compile a C file named `program.c`:

  ```bash
  gcc -o program program.c
  ```

4. Run the program:
  ```bash
  ./program
  ```

Replace `program` with the respective `program.c` file name that you have given in step 3

5. Follow the above compilation and execution steps for the specific project you want to work on. Each project may have its own source file (e.g., `program.c`), so make sure you are in the correct project directory and compile and run the corresponding source file.
