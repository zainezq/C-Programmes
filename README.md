## Project Descriptions

### Project 1: Simple Sum Calculator
- **Description**: This C program calculates the sum of two numbers. It's a basic utility designed to add any two numbers entered by the user and display the result.

### Project 2: Factorial Calculator
- **Description**: The Factorial Calculator is a C program that computes the factorial of a given number. Factorial is the product of all positive integers from 1 to the given number. This program allows users to find the factorial of a number they specify.

### Project 3: Word Occurrence Counter
- **Description**: The Word Occurrence Counter is a C program that analyzes a text file and counts the occurrences of a specific word or phrase. It's a helpful tool for text analysis and can be used for various applications such as data processing and text mining.

### Project 4: Basic Calculator
- **Description**: This Basic Calculator C program is a versatile utility that performs four fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers. Users can input two numbers and choose the operation they want to perform, and the program returns the result.

### Project 5: Meet And Greet
- **Description**: A simple C program that asks the user for their name and then greets them. 


## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to get a copy of the projects up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

**Prerequisites**:

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- C Compiler: You need a C compiler like GCC to build and run the C programs.

**Installation**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
`git clone https://github.com/zainezq/C-Programmes.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:
`cd your-repo`

3. Compile the C program. If the project requires compilation, use the appropriate compiler. For example, to compile a C file named `program.c`:

`gcc -o program program.c`

4. Run the program:
`./program`
Replace `program` with the respective `exe` file name that you have given in step 3

5. Follow the above compilation and execution steps for the specific project you want to work on. Each project may have its own source file (e.g., `program.c`), so make sure you are in the correct project directory and compile and run the corresponding source file.

6. After running the program, you will see the output on your terminal (some may prompt for input), which is typically the result of the specific project's functionality.


## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! If you'd like to contribute to the repository, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/zainezq/C-Programmes.git`
3. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix: `git checkout -b your-feature`
4. Make your changes and test them.
5. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Description of your changes"`
6. Push your changes to your forked repository: `git push origin your-feature`
7. Create a Pull Request on the main repository's GitHub page.

We will review your Pull Request and consider merging it into the main repository.
